
Brutalism is one of the bright trends in web design.
Functionality, rudeness, massive shapes, strength â€” all these are features of brutalism.
The fashion for brutalism appeared in website design in 2014 and reached its peak in 2020.
In 2022, brutalism is more likely to be considered underground.

What are the distinguishing features of brutalism in website design?

Brutalism in web design spits on neat shapes, opposes itself to overly pretentious sites, prefers simplification instead of complication.
In a computer game, brutalism would be a rude warrior with a sword or mace in his hand.
Brutalism is a bold style that deliberately combines rudeness, standardization and clumsy clarity.
There is nothing superfluous in this style, everything is clear on a subconscious level and all the information is purely on the case.
