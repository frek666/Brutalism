While brutalist buildings and their formidable exteriors can feel at odds with nature, Brutalist Plants, by Olivia Broome, shows otherwise. This beautifully-photographed tome captures the beauty of stark concrete architecture alongside lush environments—a tactic that many architects used to soften their buildings. Here you'll take in inspiring images of modernist classics and contemporary structures alike engulfed in greenery—proof that calm can co-exist with a concrete jungle.

В то время как здания в стиле брутализм и их внушительный внешний вид могут показаться противоречащими природе, "Растения в стиле брутализма" Оливии Брум доказывает обратное. Этот прекрасно сфотографированный том отражает красоту суровой бетонной архитектуры в сочетании с пышной растительностью - тактика, которую многие архитекторы использовали для смягчения своих зданий. Здесь вы увидите вдохновляющие образы классики модерна и современных зданий, утопающих в зелени, — доказательство того, что спокойствие может сосуществовать с бетонными джунглями.

Simon Phipps is back with another brutalism tome. Yet if you think this fine art photographer is just about aesthetics, think again. Instead, through his lens, he captured the rebuilding of Britain after World War II. Of course the imagery appeals to the eye, however this collection and extensive research also documents the political and social landscape following the aftermath of the war.

###  Redefining Brutalism

Simon Henley, an award-winning architect, knows a thing or two about a materials-led approach to designing buildings. But, rather than architecture, this book focuses on the social idealism that underpinned so many of brutalist buildings. For Henley the best examples were a response to society and free from hierarchies. The book goes deep into the critique of brutalism, both positive and negative, and frames this architectural movement as a living and evolving entity.

<img src="https://books.totalarch.com/files/title/5521.jpg"/>

The book examines an architectural trend called "brutalism" by critics and architects of the West. It describes what the Smithsonian Brutalist creative program could have become and what it has become. The stages of the transformation of brutalism from a movement into a "style" are analyzed: the polemic of post-war functionalism with pre-war (the collapse of SIAM), the influence of Le Corbusier, the transformation of vague socio-ethical ideas into clear aesthetic ones, the transformation of the "architecture of reforms" into another architectural reform. The book is richly illustrated. The publication is intended for architects and art historians.
