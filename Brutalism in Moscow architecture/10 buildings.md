Built in 1979 by architect Posokhin, the complex revolutionized residential construction in the USSR. The free layout, the huge underground garage by Soviet standards, pneumatic vacuum cleaners, individual apartment designs and many other innovative ideas had to radically rethink the appearance of the socialist city.

The residential buildings are connected by heated halls on the ground floor, so that you can get from one end of the neighborhood to the other without going outside. Schools, libraries, shops, and cafes were designed according to the "everything in the house" principle: their entrances were located in the lobbies of residential buildings. This turned the neighborhood into a self-sufficient residential unit.

The project did not go into production due to the high cost and design difficulties. For the same reason, a significant part of the innovative solutions remained on paper. This did not prevent the residential complex from becoming legendary even at the construction stage.

A curious fact: the film "Autumn, Chertanovo" was shot entirely in this building and its surroundings.

###  2. Aviators' House on Begovaya

The most complete and well-preserved example of a Brutalist residential building, built in 1978 by architect Andrei Meerson. The guests of the Olympic Games-80 were supposed to live here, but in the end, employees of the Znamya Truda trust settled in.

The project refers to the constructivism of the 1920s and is reminiscent of the famous Marseille Unité d'habitation complex built by Le Corbusier. The massive shape of the building is visually facilitated by 40 reinforced concrete pillars.

In addition to the "legs", the Aviator's House has many other unique features: rough surfaces with traces of wooden formwork, stairwells outside, similar to fortress towers with loopholes, a cunning design of overlapping facade slabs — for better bonding and thermal insulation, there are even concrete bowls for flower beds on each balcony. It was here that monolithic construction technology was used for the first time in the USSR.

In most of these buildings, shops and restaurants occupied the "free" space between the supporting columns on the legs, but the Aviators' House was incredibly lucky.

The building produces exactly the effect that Meerson envisioned, and looks like the setting of a science fiction movie. For example, one of the episodes of "Night Watch" was filmed here.

###  3. The House of Nuclear Scientists on Tulskaya

This monster house stretches along the highway for almost half a kilometer. The residential part is raised to the level of the fifth floor and is supported by a colonnade of more than 50 reinforced concrete pillars. Public spaces, cafes and shops are located between them.

The house was built for almost 20 years: from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s. According to legend, chief architect Vladimir Babak was a specialist in nuclear reactors and introduced a number of specific know-how into the project: in particular, an experimental ventilation system and extra-thick glass to protect against noise. The walls are positioned at an angle of 87° and 93° relative to each other — for greater stability and in case of an earthquake or nuclear war.

It is believed that the internal voids in the walls deliberately reduced the living area of the apartments so that the extra square meters would not corrupt the Soviet citizen. In fact, everything is simpler: controversial engineering decisions were the result of endless edits made to the project already during the protracted construction process. As a result, cramped apartments without hallways, beams protruding from the walls and absurd layouts. The exterior of the house was severely damaged by the installation of air conditioners and the mass unauthorized "glazing" of balconies.

A curious fact: the elevator in the building does not stop on the 3rd and 15th residential floors.

###  .4 Roscosmos on Shchepkin Street

The name of the architect of this building is unknown — apparently, the object was so secret that even such information was hidden. The austere facade, the only decoration of which is the vertical ribs of the structures, tinted windows — an unheard-of luxury for that time.

The staircase nodes located at the ends are reminiscent of the architecture of Tokyo or New York. The four—story building at the base of the tower is a fairly accurate replica of Boston City Hall, considered by architecture critics to be one of the ugliest examples of brutalism.

###  .5 The Olympic Games-80 Press Center

The main object of the Olympics-80 was not the stadium or the Sports Palace, but the press center: foreign journalists needed to be shown the best version of the USSR.

The six-storey building with an area of more than 30,000 m2 was built in just four years and equipped with the latest technology. Four more underground levels had to be added to accommodate the bulky equipment for ventilation, heating and electricity supply.

The facade is familiar to every Muscovite — now the RIA Novosti office is located here. The three upper floors, similar to an inverted Aztec pyramid, are supported by four reinforced concrete towers. The portals formed by them lead to spacious courtyards. Unfortunately, the wide arches were blocked with checkpoint booths, which destroyed the original idea of an open interior space that could be viewed from the street.

Architectural reference books repeatedly mention that the appearance of the press center was influenced by the nearby Food Warehouses, which now house the Museum of Moscow.

###  .6 Blokhin National Research Medical Center of Oncology

Built in the 1970s by architect Vinogradsky, the Blokhin National Research Medical Center of Oncology stretches along Kashirskoye Highway for half a kilometer.

The central part of the complex is a 23—storey high-rise, which is popularly called the Flea Tower. Its exterior and interiors resemble architecture from the Star Wars universe — the abstract glazed tile panels decorating the spacious central hall could easily decorate a Jedi temple.

The tower is surrounded by blocks of hospital buildings, raised to the level of the third floor by an elegant colonnade. The thin reinforced concrete supports contrast sharply with the powerful ribs of the pylons supporting the wings of the central structure. Ribbon glazing encircles the buildings around the perimeter, visually making them even more elongated.

The turrets of the staircase and elevator nodes at the corners complete the appearance of the complex, making it look like a futuristic fortress guarding the health of a Soviet citizen.

Despite the scale, the NMIC looks balanced and fits well into the architectural fabric of the area.

###  .7 Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry

From the street, the building looks almost cozy — an atypical effect for brutalism. The facade is surrounded by greenery, perfectly masking its cyclopean size. This is also facilitated by the design: the four buildings are arranged along a single diagonal axis relative to each other. They form three enclosed courtyards and leave a large space for landscaping from the street.

These square courtyards make an even more contrasting impression from the inside. Lifeless empty spaces, the only decoration of which are illuminated lanterns that provide sunlight to vast underground rooms.

The courtyards are sterile, like a scientific laboratory, and resemble the scenery for the movie "Equilibrium". The lack of inner comfort underlines the idea of architect Yuri Platonov. From a bird's—eye view, it can be seen that the building has the shape of a wriggling DNA ribbon - the image turned out to be so successful that it became the basis of the institute's logo.

The interiors of the buildings make an equally strong impression: huge spiral staircases, abstract reliefs on the walls, and an abundance of sunlight.

There is a real greenhouse inside one of the underground rooms.

###  .8 The building of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences

The most famous example of brutalism in Moscow. And the tallest one, the 120-meter central tower, is still the only dominant one in the Leninsky Prospekt metro area. The construction of the complex took an incredible 24 years: the foundation was laid in 1974, and the last of the buildings were commissioned after the collapse of the USSR in 1996.

Long-term construction often leads to a mixture of styles, and the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences has not escaped this fate. To the strict modernist ideals, the prefix "post", characteristic of the "Luzhkov" 1990s, was imperceptibly added. Archaic landscaping, inappropriate small outbuildings and decorations, sculptures by Georgy Frangulyan — all this greatly violated the original idea of architect Yuri Platonov — to create an architectural embodiment of scientific and technological progress.

The central towers were designed to house laboratories, but physicists and chemists flatly refused to move into rooms unsuitable for practical research.

The towers are crowned by the most characteristic detail of the entire complex — a complex structure made of metal and glass with a gold coating. All windows and stained glass windows in the building are tinted with the same spray.

###  .9 Dynamo Sports Palace

The sports complex built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics in the Khovrino district was ignored by architectural critics and fans of Soviet architecture. But in vain: the building has bright stylistic features, and a rare degree of preservation in its original form. The Sports Palace has passed both the reconstruction of the nineties and the inept renovation that ruined many historical sports facilities in the city.

Dynamo was built inside residential areas and is carefully integrated into the high-rise buildings of the district. The central part of the building with the inclined planes of the stands resembles the early designs of the constructivists. The facade is cut by eight reinforced concrete pillars, the space between them is decorated with corrugated metal tiles — an unusual detail for Moscow architecture of late socialism.

<img src="https://opis-cdn.tinkoffjournal.ru/mercury/43-brutalism-moscow.jpg?preset=image_760w_2x"/>

Previously, the upper part of the facade was decorated with an abstract stainless steel composition, similar to banners fluttering in the wind. Whether it became a victim of non-ferrous metal hunters in the 1990s or simply fell into disrepair and was dismantled remains a mystery.

Only the sign adorning the stylobate has been preserved in its original form. It has been unchanged since its construction and is also made of steel — a rare piece of luck for late Soviet industrial design.

###  .10 Ostankino Tower

The Ostankino Tower is a pure function embodied in reinforced concrete. Built during the era of the USSR's leadership in the space race, the tower looks like a rocket soaring into the sky. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the world. The tower held this record for 10 years.

Initially, the Ostankino Tower was planned to be built of steel — its openwork shape was supposed to resemble Shukhov's designs or the Eiffel Tower. Engineer Nikolai Nikitin's project was groundbreaking for its time — the television center was decided to be made of reinforced concrete. The strength of the building is provided by 149 cables stretched inside the hollow structure. From the balconies of residential buildings located nearby, you can clearly see how the tower sways in the wind.

<img src="https://opis-cdn.tinkoffjournal.ru/mercury/48-brutalism-moscow.jpg?preset=image_760w_2x"/>

The TV tower grows out of a cone-shaped base. According to Nikitin himself, he dreamed of it in the form of an inverted lily. The only decoration that the architects of the Moscow Project allowed to add is round windows arranged in a checkerboard pattern. However, windows also have a function: they provide additional structural strength.

At a level of 325 meters, the tower has a glass bulge, giving it a recognizable appearance. Equipment, an observation deck and a restaurant with a rotating floor are located in the thickening.
