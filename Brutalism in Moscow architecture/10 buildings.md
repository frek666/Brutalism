Built in 1979 by architect Posokhin, the complex revolutionized residential construction in the USSR. The free layout, the huge underground garage by Soviet standards, pneumatic vacuum cleaners, individual apartment designs and many other innovative ideas had to radically rethink the appearance of the socialist city.

The residential buildings are connected by heated halls on the ground floor, so that you can get from one end of the neighborhood to the other without going outside. Schools, libraries, shops, and cafes were designed according to the "everything in the house" principle: their entrances were located in the lobbies of residential buildings. This turned the neighborhood into a self-sufficient residential unit.

The most complete and well-preserved example of a Brutalist residential building, built in 1978 by architect Andrei Meerson. The guests of the Olympic Games-80 were supposed to live here, but in the end, employees of the Znamya Truda trust settled in.

The project refers to the constructivism of the 1920s and is reminiscent of the famous Marseille Unité d'habitation complex built by Le Corbusier. The massive shape of the building is visually facilitated by 40 reinforced concrete pillars.

In addition to the "legs", the Aviator's House has many other unique features: rough surfaces with traces of wooden formwork, stairwells outside, similar to fortress towers with loopholes, a cunning design of overlapping facade slabs — for better bonding and thermal insulation, there are even concrete bowls for flower beds on each balcony. It was here that monolithic construction technology was used for the first time in the USSR.

This monster house stretches along the highway for almost half a kilometer. The residential part is raised to the level of the fifth floor and is supported by a colonnade of more than 50 reinforced concrete pillars. Public spaces, cafes and shops are located between them.

The house was built for almost 20 years: from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s. According to legend, chief architect Vladimir Babak was a specialist in nuclear reactors and introduced a number of specific know-how into the project: in particular, an experimental ventilation system and extra-thick glass to protect against noise. The walls are positioned at an angle of 87° and 93° relative to each other — for greater stability and in case of an earthquake or nuclear war.

.4 Roscosmos on Shchepkin Street

The name of the architect of this building is unknown — apparently, the object was so secret that even such information was hidden. The austere facade, the only decoration of which is the vertical ribs of the structures, tinted windows — an unheard-of luxury for that time.

The staircase nodes located at the ends are reminiscent of the architecture of Tokyo or New York. The four—story building at the base of the tower is a fairly accurate replica of Boston City Hall, considered by architecture critics to be one of the ugliest examples of brutalism.

The main object of the Olympics-80 was not the stadium or the Sports Palace, but the press center: foreign journalists needed to be shown the best version of the USSR.

The six-storey building with an area of more than 30,000 m2 was built in just four years and equipped with the latest technology. Four more underground levels had to be added to accommodate the bulky equipment for ventilation, heating and electricity supply.

.6 Blokhin National Research Medical Center of Oncology

Built in the 1970s by architect Vinogradsky, the Blokhin National Research Medical Center of Oncology stretches along Kashirskoye Highway for half a kilometer.

The central part of the complex is a 23—storey high-rise, which is popularly called the Flea Tower. Its exterior and interiors resemble architecture from the Star Wars universe — the abstract glazed tile panels decorating the spacious central hall could easily decorate a Jedi temple.

The tower is surrounded by blocks of hospital buildings, raised to the level of the third floor by an elegant colonnade. The thin reinforced concrete supports contrast sharply with the powerful ribs of the pylons supporting the wings of the central structure. Ribbon glazing encircles the buildings around the perimeter, visually making them even more elongated.
