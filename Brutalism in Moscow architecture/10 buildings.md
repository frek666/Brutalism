Built in 1979 by architect Posokhin, the complex revolutionized residential construction in the USSR. The free layout, the huge underground garage by Soviet standards, pneumatic vacuum cleaners, individual apartment designs and many other innovative ideas had to radically rethink the appearance of the socialist city.

The residential buildings are connected by heated halls on the ground floor, so that you can get from one end of the neighborhood to the other without going outside. Schools, libraries, shops, and cafes were designed according to the "everything in the house" principle: their entrances were located in the lobbies of residential buildings. This turned the neighborhood into a self-sufficient residential unit.
