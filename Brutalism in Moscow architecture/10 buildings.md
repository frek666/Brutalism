Built in 1979 by architect Posokhin, the complex revolutionized residential construction in the USSR. The free layout, the huge underground garage by Soviet standards, pneumatic vacuum cleaners, individual apartment designs and many other innovative ideas had to radically rethink the appearance of the socialist city.

The residential buildings are connected by heated halls on the ground floor, so that you can get from one end of the neighborhood to the other without going outside. Schools, libraries, shops, and cafes were designed according to the "everything in the house" principle: their entrances were located in the lobbies of residential buildings. This turned the neighborhood into a self-sufficient residential unit.

The most complete and well-preserved example of a Brutalist residential building, built in 1978 by architect Andrei Meerson. The guests of the Olympic Games-80 were supposed to live here, but in the end, employees of the Znamya Truda trust settled in.

The project refers to the constructivism of the 1920s and is reminiscent of the famous Marseille Unité d'habitation complex built by Le Corbusier. The massive shape of the building is visually facilitated by 40 reinforced concrete pillars.

In addition to the "legs", the Aviator's House has many other unique features: rough surfaces with traces of wooden formwork, stairwells outside, similar to fortress towers with loopholes, a cunning design of overlapping facade slabs — for better bonding and thermal insulation, there are even concrete bowls for flower beds on each balcony. It was here that monolithic construction technology was used for the first time in the USSR.

This monster house stretches along the highway for almost half a kilometer. The residential part is raised to the level of the fifth floor and is supported by a colonnade of more than 50 reinforced concrete pillars. Public spaces, cafes and shops are located between them.

The house was built for almost 20 years: from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s. According to legend, chief architect Vladimir Babak was a specialist in nuclear reactors and introduced a number of specific know-how into the project: in particular, an experimental ventilation system and extra-thick glass to protect against noise. The walls are positioned at an angle of 87° and 93° relative to each other — for greater stability and in case of an earthquake or nuclear war.
