### **Soviet Modernism and Brutalism: Architecture of the USSR Era**  

**Soviet architectural modernism** is one of the three major architectural movements in the USSR, alongside avant-garde and Stalinist Empire style. Critics only recognized it as a distinct style in the early 21st century. This period spans 1955–1991, with its starting point being the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers’ decree of November 4, 1955, *"On the Elimination of Excesses in Design and Construction,"* which marked a departure from Stalinist opulence.  

### **Origins of the Style**  
Soviet modernism emerged in the USSR under Western influence but was reshaped by local traditions. During the Khrushchev Thaw, architects gained access to foreign professional journals and began exchanging ideas with colleagues from Poland, Cuba, and Hungary. **Internationalism** became one of its defining features.  

The foundations of Soviet modernism were heavily influenced by **Le Corbusier**, who by the 1950s had reinterpreted the principles of Soviet constructivism, creating a new architectural language.  

### **History of the Term**  
The term **"Soviet architectural modernism"** only appeared in the early 2010s. Before that, the style lacked a clear definition, and its criteria remain debated. A key figure in its popularization was French photographer **Frédéric Chaubin**, who traveled across the former USSR in the 2000s, documenting buildings initially classified as **Brutalist**.  

### **Connection to Brutalism**  
Many scholars argue that Brutalism formed the basis of Soviet modernism. Both styles share:  
- **Monumental forms** and functionality,  
- **Urban aesthetics**,  
- Heavy use of **reinforced concrete**,  
- A holistic approach to architectural design.  

Their compositions were meant to reflect the scale of socialist ideals and anti-bourgeois principles.

### **Distinct Features of Soviet Modernism**  
However, equating it entirely with Brutalism would be inaccurate. Soviet modernism had unique characteristics:  
- **Cladding materials** (marble, sandstone, ceramic, shell limestone).  
- **Decorative elements** (mosaics, bas-reliefs, monumental art).  
- **Extensive glazing**, echoing constructivism.  

### **Research and Legacy**  
The style gained recognition through:  
- **Frédéric Chaubin’s** photo project *"CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed."*  
- **Jan Kempenaers’** series *"Spomeniks,"* focusing on socialist realist monuments.  
- **Felix Novikov’s** book *"Soviet Modernism: 1955–1985."*  
- The study *"Architecture of Soviet Modernism"* on Armenian architects.  

Today, Soviet modernism is regarded as a significant architectural legacy, blending functionality, monumentality, and the unique aesthetics of its era.
