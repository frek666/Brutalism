### **Brutalism in Architecture**  

**Brutalism** (from Latin *brutus* — "rough, harsh"), also known as **New Brutalism**, is an architectural movement of the mid-20th century (1950s–1970s) that emerged in Britain as an offshoot of post-war modernism. Characteristic features of the style include massive concrete structures, pronounced material textures, and monumental forms.

### **Origin of the Term**  
The term "brutalism" was coined by the British architectural duo **Alison and Peter Smithson** to explain their 1950s projects. The name references the French *béton brut* ("raw concrete")—a technique popularized by **Le Corbusier**. The term gained widespread recognition after the publication of critic **Reyner Banham's** book *The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?* (1966).

### **Key Characteristics of the Style**  
- **Raw concrete** – No decorative finishes, emphasizing rough textures.  
- **Monumentality** – Massive forms, stepped compositions, and large scales (e.g., *Boston City Hall*, 1981).  
- **Functionality** – Exposure of structural elements (beams, slabs, utilities).  
- **Social undertones** – Many Brutalist architects saw the style as anti-bourgeois and humanistic.

### **Le Corbusier’s Influence on British Brutalism**  

Though Le Corbusier never built in Britain, his ideas became the foundation for post-war Brutalism. His concepts radically transformed architectural approaches, particularly through:  

#### **1. "Béton Brut" as a New Architectural Language**  
- Unlike traditional British brick construction, Le Corbusier promoted **raw concrete**—left rough after formwork removal, without plaster or cladding.  
- This technique became a Brutalist hallmark, symbolizing material honesty and industrial aesthetics.  

#### **2. Prototype Projects**  
- **Unité d'Habitation (Marseille, 1947–1952)** – A model for mass housing featuring:  
  - Modular apartments  
  - Integrated communal spaces  
  - Expressive concrete facades  
- **Buildings in Chandigarh & Ahmedabad (1950s–60s)** – Monumental administrative complexes with bold geometries.  

#### **3. Urban Planning Ideas**  
Le Corbusier’s "Radiant City" principles included:  
- Elevated buildings on *pilotis* (columns), freeing ground-level space.  
- Strict functional zoning (living, working, leisure).  
- These ideas materialized in **Alton West Estate (London, 1954–1959)**, mirroring the Unité d'Habitation’s layout.  

#### **4. Ideological Impact**  
- **Social idealism** – Brutalism was viewed as a tool for social change, providing affordable housing.  
- **Anti-bourgeois stance** – Rejecting ornamentation in favor of functionality challenged conventional aesthetics.  

#### **Criticism & Legacy**  
- **Polarizing reception** – Brutalist buildings (e.g., *Robin Hood Gardens, London*) were either hailed as masterpieces or derided as "concrete monstrosities."  
- **Decline** – By the 1980s, Brutalism became associated with social issues (poverty, vandalism), leading to demolitions.  
- **Modern revival** – Today, Brutalism is reappreciated for its boldness (e.g., *The Barbican Centre*, now a protected landmark).

**Key thought**:  
Le Corbusier did not build in Britain, but his philosophy of "architecture for the people" through concrete and urban ideas defined the face of British brutalism. Despite the contradictions, this trend remains an important chapter in the history of modernism.
