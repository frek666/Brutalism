### **Brutalism in Architecture**  

**Brutalism** (from Latin *brutus* — "rough, harsh"), also known as **New Brutalism**, is an architectural movement of the mid-20th century (1950s–1970s) that emerged in Britain as an offshoot of post-war modernism. Characteristic features of the style include massive concrete structures, pronounced material textures, and monumental forms.

### **Origin of the Term**  
The term "brutalism" was coined by the British architectural duo **Alison and Peter Smithson** to explain their 1950s projects. The name references the French *béton brut* ("raw concrete")—a technique popularized by **Le Corbusier**. The term gained widespread recognition after the publication of critic **Reyner Banham's** book *The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?* (1966).

### **Key Characteristics of the Style**  
- **Raw concrete** – No decorative finishes, emphasizing rough textures.  
- **Monumentality** – Massive forms, stepped compositions, and large scales (e.g., *Boston City Hall*, 1981).  
- **Functionality** – Exposure of structural elements (beams, slabs, utilities).  
- **Social undertones** – Many Brutalist architects saw the style as anti-bourgeois and humanistic.

### **Le Corbusier’s Influence on British Brutalism**  

Though Le Corbusier never built in Britain, his ideas became the foundation for post-war Brutalism. His concepts radically transformed architectural approaches, particularly through:  

#### **1. "Béton Brut" as a New Architectural Language**  
- Unlike traditional British brick construction, Le Corbusier promoted **raw concrete**—left rough after formwork removal, without plaster or cladding.  
- This technique became a Brutalist hallmark, symbolizing material honesty and industrial aesthetics.  

#### **2. Prototype Projects**  
- **Unité d'Habitation (Marseille, 1947–1952)** – A model for mass housing featuring:  
  - Modular apartments  
  - Integrated communal spaces  
  - Expressive concrete facades  
- **Buildings in Chandigarh & Ahmedabad (1950s–60s)** – Monumental administrative complexes with bold geometries.  

#### **3. Urban Planning Ideas**  
Le Corbusier’s "Radiant City" principles included:  
- Elevated buildings on *pilotis* (columns), freeing ground-level space.  
- Strict functional zoning (living, working, leisure).  
- These ideas materialized in **Alton West Estate (London, 1954–1959)**, mirroring the Unité d'Habitation’s layout.  

#### **4. Ideological Impact**  
- **Social idealism** – Brutalism was viewed as a tool for social change, providing affordable housing.  
- **Anti-bourgeois stance** – Rejecting ornamentation in favor of functionality challenged conventional aesthetics.  

#### **Criticism & Legacy**  
- **Polarizing reception** – Brutalist buildings (e.g., *Robin Hood Gardens, London*) were either hailed as masterpieces or derided as "concrete monstrosities."  
- **Decline** – By the 1980s, Brutalism became associated with social issues (poverty, vandalism), leading to demolitions.  
- **Modern revival** – Today, Brutalism is reappreciated for its boldness (e.g., *The Barbican Centre*, now a protected landmark).

### **Key Examples of Brutalist Architecture Worldwide**  

#### **1. United Kingdom**  
- **The Barbican Centre (London, 1965–1982)**

#### **2. United States**  
- **Boston City Hall (1968)**  
  Architects: Kallmann, McKinnell & Knowles  
  Bold cantilevers, exposed structures, and aggressive geometry.  

- **Pruitt-Igoe (St. Louis, 1954, demolished 1972)**  
  A notorious example of Brutalist public housing failures.  

#### **3. Europe**  
- **National Library of France (Paris, 1995)**  
  Architect: Dominique Perrault  
  Glass towers with a "forest" of internal concrete supports.  

#### **4. USSR/Russia**

### **Brutalism’s Contemporary Revival**  
1. **Neo-Brutalism** – Polished concrete (Tadao Ando) and hybrid designs (concrete + wood).  
2. **Design Influence** – Brutalist interiors, typography, and graphics.  
3. **Cultural Status** – UNESCO recognition, photography projects, and heritage tours.
